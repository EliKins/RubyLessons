# need to have a hash with an array (keys : 11, 12, 32, etc. like in math)
# where there are empty spaces - have some kind of symbol

# separate function: when asking for the X and Y, the key = x+y (strings)

# in order to have the computer decide where to place it's symbol, create a loop which
# randomizes 2 numbers and uses the adding function to create a key, check whether that space 
# is empty

# find a way to create a turn-based system

# loop to ask whether the user wants to play again
